Hoppin is a smart travel companion app that helps users discover nearby attractions, hidden
gems, and cultural spots using Google Maps and location services. Travelers can explore places on
an interactive map, post and read short reviews, upload photos, and save favorites to build
personalized itineraries. The app uses Firebase for authentication, Firestore to store user reviews
and trips, and push notifications to deliver smart recommendations â€” such as nearby spots or
timely reminders. With features like social sharing, gamified badges, and AI-powered suggestions,
Hoppin makes exploring cities more engaging, personalized, and fun.
